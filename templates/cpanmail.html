<h3>What ID/GUID do I use?</h3>
<p>If you're new to CPAN Testers, then you may not be aware of what ID or GUID to use here.
Currently CPAN Testers reports are publicly available via the CPAN Testers Reports site, using
a unique ID used by 'cpanstats' database or a GUID used by the Metabase data store. Either of
these can be used to perform a lookup. The ID or GUID is displayed via the report display on
the CPAN Testers Reports site.</p>
<p>The examples below highlight the ID and GUID in URLs you are likely to see:</p>
