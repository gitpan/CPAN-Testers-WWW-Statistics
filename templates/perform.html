<h2>Graphs</h2>
<p>The graph below highlights the rate at which testers are producing reports and the number of requests that the CPAN 
Testers Reports Website Builder can process in a day. Slow periods for the Builder are when the server has experienced
high load, typically when website crawler bots fail to honour our robots.txt file.</p>

<p>The REQUESTS measure the total number of requests processed by the system, while PAGES is the number of unique 
requests processed. A request is created when a report is submitted, a new distribution is uploaded or a website user 
requests a page on the dynamic Reports website, where a previous request exists. A page can either be a distribution 
page or an author page. Also note that for every unique page requested, 6 files are generated across 3 websites by the 
CPAN Testers Reports Website Builder.
